## 🧠 Insights

🔍 **Sales Trends**  
Sales steadily increased throughout the year, with strong growth towards mid and end-year months. Retail channels slightly outperformed warehouse channels in most months.

🏷 **Top Supplier & Product**  
Gamma Inc emerged as the highest revenue contributor, largely driven by consistent performance of the “Liquid Soap” product line.

📈 **Monthly Growth Rate**  
The dashboard includes a dynamic month-over-month sales growth tracker, highlighting performance spikes.

🧼 **Data Quality Observations**  
Raw sales data included duplicate supplier names, inconsistent month formats, and mixed text-number columns. Cleaning this data was crucial for accurate KPI tracking.
